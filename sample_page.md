## This can be your internal website page / project page

**Project description:** Our Tableau site displays interactive graphs that teaches users about the number of people that were forced to move because of natural disasters throughout the world. Through our visualizations, we hope to inspire people to take action against climate change

<!-- ### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
``` -->

### Inspiration 

Climate change will displace people. We need to help everyone, and understanding the problem is the first step.

### What it Does

Our site displays interactive graphs that teaches users about the number of people that were forced to move because of natural disasters throughout the world. Through our visualizations, we hope to inspire people to take action against climate change.

### How it Was Built 

We gathered reliable data spanning more than 10 years from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). This reports how many people had to move because of a natural disaster [(data)](https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data). Then we created multiple plots using tableau's wide selection of graphs, where we filtered the data by disasters that can be affected by climate change. We coupled this dataset with another dataset of the population of each country over time, provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#citation). We show the percentage of people that were displaced in 2021 due to a natural disaster in each country.

### Challenges
- Finding appropriate data for our visualizations
- Cleaning up the data
- Combining two datasets to find the percentage of people displaced per event
- Choosing the most impactful visualizations

### What I learned
I learned about a lot about natural disasters that have happened in the last 15 years, like the 2010 Pakistan floods. Through this project, I also have learned about the power of data visualization.
